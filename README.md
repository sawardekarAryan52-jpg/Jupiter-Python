# Jupyter-Python
Python codes written online on Jupyter platform for wide reach and online access.

The file 'Python-1' is a copy file of python codes executed on Jupyter starting from basics to mid-level coding.

Note: The kernel should not be given heavy load but incase it happens, make sure to stop the kernel, wait for a while and run for rest of the data. The kernel also needs to be 
re-run/restart after a time-gap as the libraries need to be in-procedure for running the code.

The df2 file is a csv file that contains a table of names, subject, marks, and other related info made by myself during Python study.
